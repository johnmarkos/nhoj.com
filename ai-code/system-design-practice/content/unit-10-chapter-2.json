      "explanation": "Treat candidate generation service as a reliability-control decision, not an averages-only optimization. \"Cap candidate set sizes per request class and use staged ranking to bound tail latency\" is correct since it mitigates ranking latency spikes from feature-store contention while keeping containment local.
