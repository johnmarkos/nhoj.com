      "explanation": "The operational math for Given the context, if 9% of 2,500,000 daily operations need manual recovery checks, checks/day gives 225000 operations. In interview pacing, hitting this value within +/-2% is the pass condition.",
      "detailedExplanation": "In interviews and real systems work, begin by naming the dominant constraint, then pressure-test candidate approaches against reliability, latency, and operability trade-offs. Write the unit conversion path explicitly, then calculate, then sanity-check magnitude. Tie decisions to concrete operational outcomes, not abstract reliability language. Numbers such as 9 and 2,500 should be normalized first so downstream reasoning stays consistent. Common pitfall: assuming recovery speed without operational proof.",
