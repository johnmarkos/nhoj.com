      "answer": 89600,
      "unit": "verifications/day",
      "tolerance": 0.15,
      "explanation": "2,240,000 × 4.0% ≈ 89,600 verifications/day. This estimate should drive a concrete data protection and secrets lifecycle discipline decision such as headroom, queue limits, or failover thresholds. Use this value to justify one concrete data protection and secrets lifecycle discipline decision.",
      "detailedExplanation": "The value of this number is in how it changes the design choice. In data protection and secrets lifecycle discipline, show units, assumptions, and headroom explicitly. Then map the result to a decision in this system, such as capacity limits, queue depth, or timeout budget.",
