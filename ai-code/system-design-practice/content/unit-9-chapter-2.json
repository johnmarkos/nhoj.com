      "explanation": "The sequence in Timeouts, Retries & Backoff Control should start with Undocumented ad hoc fallback and end with Automated policy-driven degradation with user semantics. Order degradation sophistication rewards stabilization-first execution before broader tuning.",
      "detailedExplanation": "If you keep \"order degradation sophistication\" in view, the correct answer separates faster. Order by relative scale and bottleneck effect, then validate neighboring items. Tie the decision to concrete operational outcomes, not abstract reliability language. Common pitfall: assuming recovery speed without operational proof.",
