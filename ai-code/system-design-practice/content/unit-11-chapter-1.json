      "explanation": "This calculation anchors the tradeoff for payments orchestration service processed 2,240,000 transactions/day while supporting multi-tenant isolation: 89600 verifications/day. Responses within +/-15% indicate sound judgment. For payments orchestration service processed 2,240,000 transactions/day while supporting multi-tenant isolation, this is the strongest fit in Threat Modeling & Attack Surfaces.",

In threat modeling and attack-surface reduction, show units, assumptions, and headroom explicitly.
