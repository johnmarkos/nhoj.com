      "detailedExplanation": "For related interview or production problems, identify the highest-signal symptom early and map it to the smallest high-leverage control change. Build the rank from biggest differences first, then refine with adjacent checks. Capacity reasoning should separate average and peak demand, then map both to saturation limits. Common pitfall: assuming linear scaling through shared bottlenecks.",
