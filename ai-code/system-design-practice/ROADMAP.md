# System Design Practice Roadmap

## Done

- [x] **Unit 1: Estimation** — 8 chapters, 1,007 problems
- [x] **Unit 2: Data Modeling** — 8 chapters, 800 problems
- [x] **Unit 3: API Design** — 8 chapters, 791 problems
- [x] **Unit 4: Storage Selection** — 8 chapters, 800 problems
- [x] **Unit 5: Caching** — 8 chapters, 800 problems
- [x] **Unit 6: Messaging & Async** — 8 chapters, 770 problems
- [x] **Unit 7: Scaling Compute** — 8 chapters, 800 problems

## Now (In Progress)

- [ ] **Unit 8: Consistency & Coordination** — planning + chapter-by-chapter content creation

## Next (Units 8-10)

- [ ] **Unit 9: Reliability** — Failure modes, redundancy, graceful degradation, circuit breakers, retries
- [ ] **Unit 10: Classic Designs Decomposed** — Twitter, URL shortener, chat, notification system — as atomic questions

## Features (After Content Complete)

- [ ] **Spaced repetition** — Track problem history, surface weak areas (depends on OpenQuizzer v1.1)
- [ ] **Skill grid** — FitStar-style Elo per dimension (estimation, data modeling, API design, etc.)
- [ ] **Progress persistence** — localStorage to resume across sessions
- [ ] **Interview simulation mode** — Timed sessions, random mix across all units

## Content Quality

- [ ] **Problem review pass** — Manual review of flagged problems (ambiguous, math errors)
- [ ] **Difficulty calibration** — Tag problems as L5/L6/L7, filter by level
- [ ] **Source citations** — Link problems to DDIA chapters, papers, or blog posts where relevant

## Maybe

- [ ] **Community contributions** — Accept PRs for new problems with quality guidelines
- [ ] **Alternative tracks** — Frontend system design, ML system design, data engineering
- [ ] **Mock interview mode** — 45-minute timed session with problem mix matching real interviews

## Won't Do

- Video explanations — text is faster and more bus-friendly
- Discussion forums — use GitHub issues
- Certification or badges — not the point
